            {/* Strong emphasis on the importance of time and life */}
            <strong>Time is the most important asset.</strong> Time does not equal
            money. <strong>Time equals life.</strong> And you only have one chance
            to make it right.{' '}
            {/* Encouragement to help and inspire others */}
            <strong>
              Every human being is fighting a battle inside themselves.
            </strong>{' '}
            It's your <strong>obligation</strong> to help and{' '}
            <strong>inspire</strong> them. Regardless of what you do, you can
            always inspire others to do good. Nobody is better than you.{' '}
            {/* Emphasis on humility */}
            <strong>And you're not better than anybody else.</strong> Be humble.
            {/* Encouragement to step out of the comfort zone */}
            Being in the <strong>comfort zone</strong> is wonderful, but nothing
            ever grows there. Keep studying. <strong>Keep creating.</strong>{' '}
            {/* Advice on handling criticism */}
            Haters will come if you have the{' '}
            <strong>audacity to build something new</strong>. Don't let them
            define you. <strong>Don't let them stop you.</strong> Just block them
            and keep going. {/* Emphasis on personal responsibility and happiness */}
            Don't expect <strong>others to make you happy</strong>. You are the only one
            <strong>responsible for your happiness</strong>. <strong>Don't wait</strong>
            until Friday to enjoy life. Joy should be present in everything you do.{' '}
            {/* Respect for parents */}
            <strong>Be kind to your parents</strong>. They gave up many things for
            you. Having hundreds of <strong>people admiring you</strong> is
            worthless if you're not admired by your own family. Don't fear the
            unknown. Fear knowing everything.{' '}
            {/* Emphasis on the shortness of life and taking action */}
            <strong>Life is too damn short</strong>, and every day counts.{' '}
            <strong>Do what you wanna do and do it now</strong>. Tick-tock don't
            stop. Tick-tock don't wait.
